If the tests are not being executed as expected, there could be several potential issues to investigate:\n\n1. **Test Discovery**: Ensure that your Selenium tests are correctly discovered by `pytest`. By default, `pytest` looks for files matching the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`. Make sure your test files and test functions follow this naming convention.\n\n2. **Test Location**: Verify that your test files are located in the correct directory relative to where the GitHub Actions runner is executing the commands. If your tests are in a subdirectory, you might need to specify the path in the `pytest` command, like so:\n   ```yaml\n   run: |\n     pytest path/to/your/tests --html=reports/test_report.html || true\n   ```\n\n3. **Selenium WebDriver Setup**: Ensure that your Selenium WebDriver is correctly set up and accessible. If your tests require a specific browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver), make sure it's installed and added to the system's PATH.\n\n4. **Dependencies**: Double-check that all necessary dependencies for running Selenium tests are listed in your `requirements.txt` file and are installed correctly. This includes Selenium itself and any browser drivers or additional libraries your tests might depend on.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: The `|| true` at the end of the `pytest` command allows the step to pass even if tests fail. While this is useful for ensuring subsequent steps run, it can mask issues with test execution. Consider removing it temporarily to see if there are any errors preventing the tests from running:\n   ```yaml\n   run: |\n     pytest --html=reports/test_report.html\n   ```\n\n6. **Logging and Output**: Check the logs from the GitHub Actions run for any error messages or output that might indicate why the tests aren't being executed. This can provide clues about missing dependencies, incorrect paths, or other issues.\n\n7. **Screenshots and Reports**: Ensure that the directories for reports and screenshots (`reports/` and `screenshots/`) exist or are created during the workflow. If they don't exist, the upload steps might fail silently.\n\n8. **Python Version**: Verify that Python 3.13 is compatible with all the libraries you're using, as it might be a pre-release version. Consider using a stable version like Python 3.9 or 3.10 if compatibility issues arise.\n\n### Example Enhancement\n\nHere's an enhanced version of the `Run Selenium Tests with HTML Report` step, assuming your tests are in a directory named `tests`:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Run Selenium Tests with HTML Report\n  run: |\n    pytest tests --html=reports/test_report.html\n```\n\n### Further Enhancements\n\n- **Parallel Execution**: Consider using `pytest-xdist` to run tests in parallel, which can speed up execution.\n- **Environment Variables**: If your tests require environment variables, ensure they're set in the workflow.\n- **Browser Configuration**: If using a headless browser, ensure the necessary flags are set in your WebDriver configuration.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you should be able to diagnose why the Selenium tests aren't being executed and make the necessary adjustments to your workflow.&lt;div class=\&quot;source-files\&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;details&gt;\n\n\n\n\n \n\n &lt;summary&gt;&lt;span class='reference'&gt; Sources-Repos/Files: &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/summary&gt;\n  \n - User added code context\n &lt;/details&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;userMessage&quot;:null,&quot;serpResults&quot;:null,&quot;images&quot;:[],&quot;additionalSvgContent&quot;:[],&quot;timestamp&quot;:&quot;2025-04-01T12:21:56.914508800Z&quot;,&quot;documentDataList&quot;:[],&quot;listOfFiles&quot;:[&quot;workflows/sample.yml Lines(1-43)&quot;]}],&quot;clientCode&quot;:&quot;pschat.chat.completion&quot;,&quot;model&quot;:&quot;PSChat&quot;,&quot;provider&quot;:&quot;LionChatRag&quot;,&quot;providerModel&quot;:&quot;gpt-4o&quot;,&quot;createdOn&quot;:[2025,4,1,15,15,17,902121400],&quot;updatedOn&quot;:[2025,4,1,17,52,14,941597200],&quot;discardTokenLimit&quot;:false,&quot;chatId&quot;:&quot;f1f92b8e-2de2-4aa7-a2dc-70461e678093&quot;,&quot;chatTabName&quot;:&quot;DEFAULT&quot;}]}}" />
